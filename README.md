# odin-recipes

I'm gonna do my personal project about page that contains links to food recepies. I will use only pure HTML without CSS and also with no added functionality with Javascript.
I'm gonna use tags like anchor for linking another pages, ofcourse some headings tags and paragraphs and also some images to reference how the food looks like. I'm very exited for my first project from Odin project.
Recipes of my choice will be traditional Czech foods like guláš, svíčková and knedlo vepřo zelo i would highly recommend to have glass of beer after you finish you're meal for better digestion.
